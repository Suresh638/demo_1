# Rapid-Copies

The main problem identified during this academic year is the overcrowding of students in the xerox shop which leads to delays in attending classes. This affects the student studies by getting late to the class and overtiming in the xerox shop. To overcome this issue, we developed a website named <span style="color:blue">Rapid copies</span> which fast up the speed since everything will be online except getting hard copies on hand. Our work demonstrates that the proposed solution enables this upcoming year to be efficient by issuing the copies at their preferable time without getting mess around the shop.
